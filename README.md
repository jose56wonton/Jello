# Jello
### What
Jello is a [Trello](www.trello.com) clone.
### Why
1. I want to continue working with React and Redux
2. I want to get more familiar with Node, Express, MongoDB
3. I want to try Paper-CSS(CSS Framework) and Draggable.js(JS library)
### Status
As of now the project doesn't interact with a database. I started this project just before finals, and I have been really busy/am really tired of it. I am moving on. 
That said I learned a lot about backend stuff. If you want to see my first schemas and routes your can check out the Server folder :D
### Plans
As of now I actually hate this project so I don't plan on coming back to it. But I am definitely going to continue learning backend stuff, and will start a new project tomorrow.
